# **CanvasForCause**
### **A Digital Platform Integrating Technology and Art for Self-Expression and Connection**


## Project Description

CanvasForCause is a full-stack MERN application that bridges technology and art to create a supportive community platform for self-expression. The platform enables users to create digital artwork through a virtual canvas, upload physical artwork, share personal stories behind their creations, and connect with others through a community gallery.

Art has always been a universal language of self-expression, offering individuals a therapeutic outlet for emotions and creativity. However, existing platforms don't fully address emotional expression through art and its impact on mental well-being. CanvasForCause aims to fill this gap by creating a space where art becomes a medium for connection, storytelling, and personal growth.
